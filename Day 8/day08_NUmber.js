/* Number :- Number Types

JavaScript has only one type of number.
Numbers can be written with or without decimals.

ex. 
let x = 3.14;    // A number with decimals
let y = 3;    // A number without decimals

// JS Bitwise Operator :- 

/*

& [AND] =>	Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1
|  [OR] =>  	Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1
^ [XOR] => 	Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1
~ [NOT] =>  	Inverts all the bits
<< [Left Shift] =>	Shifts left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off
>> [Right shift] =>	Shifts right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off
